# Chef Intermediate Training Pre-flight

We are going to verify that attendees are setup properly, and the facilities will not cause issues. 

## What do the scripts do?

* Do the users have local admin rights to install items to their systems?
  * If not, can they be granted?

Are users behind a proxy or other restrictive firewall?
Verify web connectivity to:

* aws.amazon.com
* manage.chef.com
* supermarket.chef.io
* api.chef.io
* rubygems.org
* portquiz.net
* downloads.chef.io/chef-dk
* github.com/chef-training

Verify RDP connectivity:
* Outbound to AWS

### Network Requirements

Outbound: ports 22 (SSH), * .chef.io, * .aws.amazon.com, and if possible, drive.google.com

We ask that you run the "pre-flight" script that Chef has put together and return the results to us in a timely fashion. To do this, please connect a typical laptop a student might be using to the network we will be utilizing for the class. 

Running the script will then generate a report of the network connectivity (preflight_results) and inform you if any critical servers cannot be reached. If failures are detected they will be logged in the resulting .txt or .csv file, which should be returned to us. It may be necessary to contact your networking team to resolve any issues before our trainer comes on-site.

# Execution Example

If we assume a Windows workstation, then for Chef Intermediate course:

The simplest method is to navigate to the downloaded scripts in Windows Explorer (launched with WINDOWS + E ), right-clicking on the appropriate script, and clicking “Run with PowerShell”. You will need to give administrative access for the script to complete properly.

Alternatively:

1. Open a Powershell prompt. This can be done easily by using the keystroke ( WINDOWS + X + A ), or by opening the start menu ( WINDOWS ) and searching for “powershell”.

2. Navigate to the location where you downloaded the scripts to. This will most likely be your downloads directory. You can change into this directory by running the following inside of your powershell prompt:

  * cd ~\Downloads\

3. And then execute the script located inside of: chef-preflight-intermediate -> windows_preflight.ps1

  * .\chef-preflight-intermediate\windows_preflight.ps1

  * You will want to run the executable from within the same environment (such as from within the classroom or on the same network) as we'll be using in class.  

4. Forward the generated “preflight_results.csv” file back to our team.

*Our team will review the results of the pre-flight script. Please let us know if you need any further assistance. We are happy to help.*

*We’re looking forward to working with your team!*
